Subject: [Medick-devel] Medick 0.3.0pre1 Compatibility Breaks
Message-ID: <514f44140607010854j739360ffn1d9622af0ed35e99@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've started to work on version 0.3.0 version of medick, a php 5 web
framework (not a collection of classes!).

Since I'm going to introduce some compatibility breaks with older
versions of medick (0.2.3) I have decided to create minor pre-releases
up to 0.3.0.

The first one will be version 0.3.0pre1.

Compatibility Breaks in 0.3.0pre1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Medick 0.3.0 will require php version 5.1.2 or higher.
That's it, if you want to use medick you have to upgrade php to
version 5.1.2 or 5.1.4.

2. A new ActiveRecord Validation API that will change the syntax.

So instead of:

class Foo extends ActiveRecord {

  [...]
    $this->validates()->presence_of('foo','bar');
    $this->validates()->uniqueness_of('foo','bar');
  [...]

}

you need to change to:

class Foo extends ActiveRecord {

  [...]
    $this->validates_presence_of('foo','bar');
    $this->validates_uniqueness_of('foo','bar');
  [...]

}

( replace validates() with validates_ ).

3. A new ActiveRecord Validation API will remove the DatabaseRow class.
Up to now, in medick an ActiveRecord had a DatabaseRow class attached
filled with Fields objects.
Since an ActiveRecord should represent a row from the database, I'm
going to remove the class DatabaseRow, and add an array of Fields to
medick`s ActiveRecord.

So if you are using the DatabaseRow object in an ActiveRecord to get a
specific Field:

$this->row->getFieldByName( __FIELD__NAME__ );

you will have to change and access the Field in a straight way:

$this->getField( __FIELD__NAME__ );

Instead of:
$this->row->getFieldByName( __FIELD__NAME__ )->addError(__ERROR__MESSAGE__);
you should use:
$this->getField( __FIELD__NAME__ )->addError(__ERROR__MESSAGE__);

This will also bring a small performance boost to medick ActiveRecord.

Subject: [Medick-devel] Medick 0.3.0pre2 Breaks
Message-ID: <514f44140607230546p21d40b0cl599f9edb4f6d1f66@mail.gmail.com>

As announced[1] earlier this month, pre-release 2 for medick 0.3.0
will add new compatibility breaks.
One of the goal to the final 0.3.0 is to remove the XML configuration file.
The first step is introduced in 0.3.0pre2 and it will remove the
database section from the configuration file.
This section is now replaced by a ini style file, called database.ini
and placed in APPLICATION/conf/database.ini.

To upgrade from a previous medick version, create a new file
conf/database.ini and take a look at this samples to see what you can
set there:
http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/medick/applications/cookbook/conf/database.ini?op=file&rev=0&sc=1
http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/medick/applications/eltodo/conf/database.ini?op=file&rev=0&sc=1
http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/medick/applications/testor/conf/database.ini?op=file&rev=0&sc=1
http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/medick/trunk/skel/config/database.ini?op=file&rev=0&sc=1

Soon medick-0.3.0pre2 will be available for download.
