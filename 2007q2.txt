Dear all,

The medick PHP5 Framework is still alive and I hope to release a new
version by the end of this week. The new medick version will be 0.4
and not 0.3.

Compatibility breaks:

1. Last year, the plan was to remove the XML configuration file and to
introduce some plain PHP code to configure a medick application.

After one year, I don't think that I want to make this change, even
more, I will like to revert the database settings back to the XML once
again.

2. In medick one could use an array of strings as before filters for
controllers, but the method to do so was called *before_filter*, so it
will make more sense to rename that to *before_filters*.

New features:

1. after filters for controllers
2. HTTPRequest gets a is_xhr() method to indicate if the request was
made using an AJAX call
3. medick will know how to render JSON with render_json

Today, while I was reading the code from ActionController, I have
realized how many nice features medick has but without any
documentation. So the focus for me is the documentation.


That's it for now. Take care.
